## Notes

I learned a lot about the Twitter API and how to implement the various features of the API to make my own version of the app. One issue I had was in the beginning with learning how to get the various things I needed like the username or the tweet text. I had to spend time understanding the json file and what each object referred to. After understanding the API, it was easier to start implementing it into my project.
